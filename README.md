# 👋 Hi, I'm Ifeanyi Martins Nwanegbo  
# Data Engineer | Data Scientist | Cloud Engineer | Analytics Professional  

Welcome to my technical portfolio, a curated collection of the projects, systems, and tools I build across data engineering, data science, cloud computing, analytics, and machine learning. I am passionate about designing scalable pipelines, solving real-world problems with data, and building intelligent systems that create business impact.

## Featured Projects

**Analytics Engineering – Supply Chain Cost Optimization (Python)**

Designed and implemented an operations analytics model to determine optimal shipment quantities from two factories to three customer regions. The model minimizes total logistics and production cost under real-world constraints, enforcing exact demand fulfillment, factory capacity limits, non-negative flows, and nonlinear production cost functions using SciPy’s SLSQP algorithm.

### What this project does
- Models a two-factory, three-customer supply network with capacity-constrained production
- Optimizes shipment flows to minimize combined shipping and nonlinear production costs
- Enforces exact customer demand satisfaction and factory capacity limits
- Uses constrained nonlinear optimization (SLSQP) to compute optimal flows
- Outputs shipment plans, factory utilization, and minimum total cost

#### Tech used
- Python, NumPy, SciPy
- Nonlinear constrained optimization (SLSQP)

#### Code
- [`optimize_supply_chain.py`](src/optimize/optimize_supply_chain.py)

**Results Summary**
- All customer demand was met exactly while respecting factory capacity constraints
- Optimization minimized total logistics and production cost to **657,494.94**
- Factory B handled most shipments due to lower unit costs for C1 and C2
- Model validated through successful local execution

#### Sample Output

Optimization successful

Optimal shipment quantities (units):
A -> C1: 0.00
A -> C2: 0.00
A -> C3: 267.89
B -> C1: 300.00
B -> C2: 200.00
B -> C3: 32.11

Factory totals:
Total from A: 267.89 / 500.00
Total from B: 532.11 / 700.00

Minimum total cost: 657,494.94
